A Schloss (castle) has the best Baeckerei (bakery) in Berlin (capital of Germany).
The most wettbewerbs (competetive) beer drinkers gather in the Biergarten (beer garden) to show off their skills.
Every Hund (dog) in Berlin loves the smell of Bratwurst (sausage) coming from the Hauptstrasse (main road).
The waitstaff are faehig (capable) enough to deftly move through a crowded Ratskeller (basement restaraunt), even in a Dirndel (traditional German dress)!
